## Description of the Data Set
Manga is another word for japanese comics. Many people may heard of Akira, Astro Boy, Dragon Ball, and Ghost in the Shell. All of these popular movies and shows are based from manga.

This data set displays the top 500 manga on a famous website known as MyAnimeList. Everyday, countless users on MyAnimeList may rate a particular manga. Then, the website takes the mean score and uses that as the manga's overall score. In this database's case, the top 500 are selected based on the manga's overall score. Along with the score, MyAnimeList provides additional details on every individual manga. The website provides each manga's author, serialization, year released, genres, popularity rank, and the number of user ratings. It also includes a synopsis for every individual manga. As a result, the data set includes all these details as well.

## Why I Selected This Data Set
Personally, I chose this data set because manga has been a huge part of my life. Ever since I was 6, I started reading manga everytime I went to a book store or a library. Currently, whenever I feel down or bored, it is easy to just pick up my phone and read manga online. Each individual manga provides plenty of amazing stories, interesting characters, and beautiful artwork that I could never be bored of. With the rapidly growing japanese entertainment industry, manga has been gaining massive popularity all around the globe. Now with mainstream media such as Netflix overflowing with japanese animation, it is not surprising for their source material to gain massive popularity as well. Therefore, not only did I choose this data set due to my love for reading manga, I also chose this data set because I was curious to what manga is the most popular and why it was popular. This topic allowed me to compare different genres to popularity, and find out which demographic enjoys manga the most. It also allows me to compare the ratings and popularity of manga throughout the years now that the japanese entertainment industry is booming in this day and age.
